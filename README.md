This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Frontend-Recruitment

Projeto de seleção da Netshoes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

To install all dependencies.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will be reloaded along with the API provided products.<br />
You also won't see any lint errors on the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Comments

The project made with React using react-redux for data persistence.

For styling, a styled-components library was used for its various benefits. Easy application, maintenance and no style inheritance.

As a good practice, the prop-types library was also used.

Unfortunately I was unable to deliver the tests and also a notification system like react-toast.
This failure was due to lack of sufficient knowledge and time.

Anyway, the application was developed with all the requested features with total dedication for the best experience.

Criticisms and suggestions are welcome, please allow me to improve.

Have fun!
